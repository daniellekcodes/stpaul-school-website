                    <p>By providing a rigorous curriculum in a caring atmosphere touting small student- to-faculty
                        ratio, students grow up to be independent thinkers. It is our foremost goal to prepare students
                        in every aspect so that they can develop the confidence necessary for success in their next

                        SPPS teachers are experts with hearts. Teachers are passionate about getting to know each and
                        every student. Strong bonds between teachers and students develop a vibrant community life and
                        lead to exceptional learning in our classrooms and beyond. â€¢ All students, regardless of their
                        interests or future pursuits, are learning to develop their written and oral communication
                        abilities for future success as scholars. SPPS incorporates various teaching methods to further
                        develop communication skills so that students are able to think critically and express
                        themselves logically as mature learners.
