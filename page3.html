                <h2> Student Organizations</h2>
                <p>Alongside their academic exploration, the students at SPPS participate in diverse clubs and student
                    organizations. Steeped in the principles of independency and responsibility, student organizations
                    are completely student-led, thus creating a community that thinks spontaneously, moves ambitiously
                    and plays responsibly. More than 22 clubs plan numerous school-wide events each school year and work
                    closely with the faculty and staffs to host meaningful activities. In learning how to balance
                    academic pursuits and extracurricular interests, students develop various organizational skills that
                    are critical to their social development. The school's intimate size facilitates student ownership
                    and therefore deepens their commitments.</p>

                <p>SPPS is motivated by the belief that nurturing students to develop a clear sense of responsibility
                    will develop global citizens who transform the world for the better, to achieve overall harmony.
                    Understanding our nature and the need for interpersonal relationships, we strongly encourage
                    students to participate in as many community service activities as possible to increase their
                    awareness for social responsibility.</p>

                <p>The SPPS Homeroom system provides a strong network of support to make students feel connected and

                    competitions cooperatively throughout the year, each homeroom builds a unique identity that enhances
                    a stronger sense of cohesion and belongingness to the community.</p>
